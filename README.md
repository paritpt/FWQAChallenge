1. Description of the problem and solution.
    I learn how to manipulate Robot from Udemy course. 
Lecturer from Udemy made his lesson in 2019, unfortunately some Robot keywords he using isn’t work anymore. Thus, I need to google the updated version of them.
    As a beginner at Robot framework, everything seems to be so difficult at first. 
I managed to maintain my mental health and carry on my work progression by taking good care of work-life balance. 
A lot of confusing bugs was found but those bugs can be solved well at last.
Special thanks to www.stackoverflow.com
- In test script "Sign up with email account", I found that the verification code isn’t really sent to my e-mail. Leading to incomplete registration.
- In Testcase3, I can’t figure out how to test filter and category buttons. 
- In test script "Search by typing keyword" I used "Wait Until Element Contains" to make sure that keyword was displayed properly. 
Filter and category buttons are different. I can't find the way to verify these test scripts. Therefore, I decided to do only what I can do in a limited time.

2. Reasoning behind your technical choices.
    This is my very first automation coding. Thereby I try my best in order to simplest them as I can. 
According to your suggestion, I’m able to handle Robot Framework since I think that Fast Work’s QA tasks are mostly relevant with Robot Framework too.
It’s reasonable to study and understand the Framework that my expected organization used. 
I also used Selenium library as it’s got a large community of user giving me a solution or clue when I’m stuck with challenge problems are.
